### Introduction

This  project is undertaken to fullfill my development and mastery of content taught in phase one, which traverse markdown language, styling and javascript inclusion for responsive sites.

### Project description

With the advancement and ease of access to technology, job seeking and service delivery can be done from the comfort of people's palms.
with this approach, I identified seeking qualified, trustworthy and skilled labour and service delivery people a challenge in the modern community due to reduced social interaction. Kazi Mashinani aims to bridge this gap by allowing service and goods delivery people to list themselves on the platform, be rated and thus available for work, while seekers or potential employers may browse these lists and book or hire professionals.

### MVP
These are categorized in two:

1. As a job seeker, I am able to:
    1. Upload my profile and review it before posting
    1. Delete my profile
    1. Browse and other people that offer their services
1. As a potential employer, I am able to:
    1. View worker profiles
    1. Access worker contact information
    1. Rate worker after service delivery.
